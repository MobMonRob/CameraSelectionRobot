/*
This module gets the path of the resource(image) folder of the project
Declaring into the code a String and write the absolute path there is not an option
If so, the path will work only in that computer
Relative paths are necessary to dinamically export it to other computers
However, the SikuliX library was having problems with the relatives path
This code was necessary to "calculate" the absolute path but depending on the computer

The class is abstract because each folder is handled by other classes
The other classes will be concrete
This class just provides the basic services
The concrete classes know how to handle each folder
